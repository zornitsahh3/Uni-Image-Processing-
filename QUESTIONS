-what means '8-bit color channels' 
A digital color image is usually made of three color components:
Red
Green
Blue
Each component (channel) has a certain number of possible values.
When we say 8-bit channel, we mean:
The channel uses 8 bits (1 byte) to store its value.
So an 8-bit red channel means the "red amount" of each pixel is between 0 (no red) and 255 (maximum red).
Most standard images (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.) use:
8-bit Red + 8-bit Green + 8-bit Blue = 24-bit color image
Example pixel:
Red = 200
Green = 120
Blue = 50
-------------------------------------
-What is a color channel?
A color channel is one of the three components that together form the pixel’s color.
Think of an image as three black-and-white images stacked:
Red channel   (0–255)
Green channel (0–255)
Blue channel  (0–255)
Each pixel has one value for each of the three channels.
When you take the red channel and visualize it alone, you see how much red intensity each pixel contains.
Qt extracts channel values like this:
qRed(pixel)
qGreen(pixel)
qBlue(pixel)
-------------------------------------
What does hold one value per intensity level mean?
The histogram array:
double hR[256];
has 256 elements.
Each element corresponds to one possible intensity from 0 to 255.
So:
hR[0] = how many pixels had red intensity = 0
hR[1] = how many pixels had red intensity = 1
...
hR[255] = how many pixels had red intensity = 255
Count how often each possible value occurs.
-------------------------------------
What are histogram bins?
A bin is simply a bucket that collects values in a histogram.
In this case:
There are 256 bins.
Bin 0 counts how many pixels have intensity 0.
Bin 1 counts how many pixels have intensity 1
…
Bin 255 counts intensity 255.

What is QRgb, and why do we use it?
QRgb is a Qt type that represents one 32-bit pixel:
[ Alpha (8 bits) | Red (8 bits) | Green (8 bits) | Blue (8 bits) ]
Internally it’s typically an unsigned 32-bit integer.
Example (in hex):
0xFF32A7C1
FF = alpha
32 = red
A7 = green
C1 = blue
Qt provides helpful functions:
qRed(pixel)    → extracts the red bits
qGreen(pixel)  → extracts green
qBlue(pixel)   → extracts blue
qAlpha(pixel)  → extracts alpha
We use QRgb because:
It matches the memory format of QImage::Format_RGB32
It lets us easily extract color channels
